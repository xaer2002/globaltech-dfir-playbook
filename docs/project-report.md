1. Introduction

Cyberattacks have become increasingly sophisticated, with ransomware representing one of the most damaging threats to organizations. Ransomware groups now employ advanced tactics, including dual extortion, credential theft, lateral movement, and encryption of critical systems. As a result, organizations must implement proven digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) processes to minimize damage, preserve evidence, and rapidly restore operations.

This project focuses on developing a comprehensive digital forensics and incident response (DFIR) playbook designed for a targeted ransomware attack at GlobalTech Corp. The goal is to create a structured, repeatable, and professional-grade process that aligns with the six-phase incident response lifecycle and industry best practices such as NIST SP 800-61, MITER AT&CK, and standard forensic methods.

Completed deliverables include a full playbook, a user manual, a chain-of-custody template, and a fully documented GitHub repository.

2. Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are:

1. Develop a complete DFIR playbook

Conformity to enterprise security standards, including:

Identifying Ransomware Behavior

Prevention and Elimination Procedures

forensic evidence management

chain of custody compliance

Recovery and lessons learned

2. Perform forensic methodology

These include:

memory acquisition (volatile data)

Disk Imaging and Hashing

Log collection and timeline reconstruction

IoC correlation and malware triage

3. Provide a practical process
